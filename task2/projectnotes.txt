Project notes:
1. everytime a file is open, it transfer the data to an array and overwrites the file
2. if the file is not saved, everything will be lost

3. when file is save, data not written over to the .txt
4. upon exit, the data will be written over
5. if file is not save but exit, then nothing will be written over/everything will be gone

Project questions:
1. is the shopping cart OOP good?
