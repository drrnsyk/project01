Project notes:
1. everytime a file is open, it transfer the data to an array and overwrites the file
2. if the file is not saved, everything will be lost

3. when file is save, data not written over to the .txt
4. upon exit, the data will be written over
5. if file is not save but exit, then nothing will be written over/everything will be gone

6. Server will always be running even when no client is connected, do we need to create a function to kill it?
7. The last client which does not have a thread will wait, but when connection is received by server, the client is not responsive

Project questions:
1. is the shopping cart OOP good?

Things to improve:
1. Change IO to OOP
